# v0-workbench-config

This is the Klipper configuration for my Voron V0, Workbench.

It uses my [common macros](https://github.com/simplisticton/common-macros) too, which are shared with [V2-2566](https://github.com/simplisticton/v2-2566config), my Voron 2.4.

Feel free to use anything you find here, but remember, if it breaks, you get to keep the pieces.
